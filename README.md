# Data-Science-Portfolio
Hello! I am a Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering as well as a postgraduate in AIML from Lambton College with a passion for solving real world problems using data science and machine learning.
Here I have used python libraries to work on several large scale datasets on domains such as healthcare, marketing and logistics.

## Skills
- **Programming:** Python,
- **Libraries/Frameworks:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Featured Projects
1. ** Predictive Analytics for Patient Readmissions
  Patient readmissions pose a significant challenge for healthcare providers, leading to increased operational costs and penalties under healthcare regulations.
  This pilot project aims to develop a predictive analytics solution to identify patients at high risk of readmission. By leveraging historical data and machine learning algorithms,
  the solution will provide actionable insights to healthcare providers, enabling them to implement targeted interventions that improve patient outcomes and reduce readmission rates.
  Tools :- Python, scikit - learn
